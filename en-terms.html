          “Al Rawan Residential” App
        </h2>
        <p>Last Updated: 2024-08-20</p>

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          By using the Al-Rawan Residential Complex App (“the App”), you agree
          to comply with the following terms and conditions (“Terms”). Please
          read these Terms carefully before using the App. If you do not agree
          to any part of these Terms, you should not use the App.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Accounts</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Owner Account:</strong> A dedicated account is created for
          each unit owner within the complex to view unit details, such as the
          unit code, payment invoices, and payment reminders. The owner is
          responsible for updating the account information accurately and
          maintaining the confidentiality of login credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Customer Profile:</strong> Users can update their profile
          picture and view payment details for their residential unit. The app
          reserves the right to modify or cancel any account that violates these
          Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Billing and Payments</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Monthly Service Bills:</strong> The App provides a view of
          monthly bills for services offered in the complex, such as security,
          cleaning, water, gas, and internet services. Activating facial
          recognition to avoid unintended maintenance requests is the user’s
          responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payments:</strong> All payments must be made through the
          approved platforms within the App. Users are responsible for ensuring
          the accuracy of payment details and completing the transaction.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Maintenance and Maintenance Requests</h3>
        <p>
          Users can submit maintenance requests through the App. To avoid
          unwanted requests, facial recognition is activated before completing
          the request. Users are responsible for any maintenance requests
          submitted by mistake.
        </p>

        <h3>5. QR Code Sharing for Guests</h3>
        <p>
          The App allows users to share a QR code with guests when they visit
          the complex. Users must ensure the code is used correctly, as it is
          valid for a single use only.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Security Guards Account</h3>
        <p>
          The App provides a dedicated account for the complex’s security guards
          to scan guests’ QR codes. Guards are required to use this account
          strictly for work-related security purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Notifications</h3>
        <p>
          The App sends regular notifications about the latest news related to
          the complex, as well as alerts about available sales offers. Users are
          responsible for keeping track of these notifications.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Sales Management</h3>
        <p>
          Prospective buyers can reserve residential units by filling out
          personal information (name, mobile number, ID) and submitting it to
          the sales team through the App. All sales transactions are completed
          following the legally approved procedures.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          The App is committed to protecting users’ privacy according to its
          privacy policies. Personal data is collected and processed solely for
          service improvement and user needs fulfillment.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
          The App is provided “as is” without any warranties. The App developers
          or complex management shall not be held liable for any damages arising
          from the use of the App or reliance on its content.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Amendments to Terms</h3>
        <p>
          The App reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. Users
          will be notified of any significant changes through the App.
          Continuing to use the App after any modification constitutes
          acceptance of the revised Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>12. Governing Law</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
          of the country where the complex is located. Any disputes arising from
          these Terms will be resolved in the courts of that country.
